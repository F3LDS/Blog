Once again the extreme boredom I experience in math has birthed forth a new game concept. This ones working name is Slumber. I don’t know much beyond there will be bad-ass lighting mechanics and terrifying creatures. I’m thinking I might have to bring the BluOwl team on board for this one. Its gonna be a doozy.

Side note: I whipped this poster up in ProCreate for iPad. Not bad eh? Maybe I can draw after all.
