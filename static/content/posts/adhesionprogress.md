title: Adhesion Progress
date: April 14, 2013

I made some significant progress on Adhesion today. I implemented a system for reading and loading map files with a single line of code which will make future level generation an absolute breeze. All I do is change the file argument in this line of code

And BAM! The level and the window is resized to fit it perfectly. Let’s see this in action shall we?

With level1.dat loaded:

This map is generated by iterating through a file containing ones, zeros, and twos to represent walls, empty space, and switches respectively. The file used to generate this level looks like this

This file is read line by line and stored in a nested table system.”x” and “y” in this table system represent what line and character we’re currently reading. Then all we have to do is run this little beauty here

And the file is rendered out into our window.

Once again, with this system in place all I have to do is tell it to load level2.dat and it automatically renders the new map and resizes the window to fit it like so

Pretty neat huh? Up next is to store buttons, players, and pieces into their own arrays so we can detect when they bump into each other by comparing their locations.
